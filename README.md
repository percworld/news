## News Worthy

### This technical take-home challenge will demonstrate my learnings of JavaScript, React and HTML/CSS during my time at Turing. Cypress testing will be used to do end-to-end testing of the application.  The New York Times API will be consumed and is available here: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview

### This challenge is meant to be completed in 6 hours.

### Endpoints:
Top stories will be searched by query parameters. URIs are relative to https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/{section}.json

The possible section values are: arts, automobiles, books, business, fashion, food, health, home, insider, magazine, movies, nyregion, obituaries, opinion, politics, realestate, science, sports, sundayreview, technology, theater, t-magazine, travel, upshot, us, and world.

##User Persona
I believe a user persona detail can help determine the user experience beforehand and prepare our project with a base for moving forward with wireframing.
